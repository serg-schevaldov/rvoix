Almost all stock HTC kernels have a bug which reboots the phone on incoming call if you try to enable any auto-answering options.

To prevent this, you need a patched kernel. The patch itself is here http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=878268 but several ROM makers have already included it in their kernels. Please check the XDA site and/or ask your kernel makers to apply this patch.

This program is capable of recording phone calls directly from the phone line. To this end, it uses the drivers available for devices based on **Qualcomm chips only** (like msm72xx or Snapdragon); devices based on **any other chips** are not supported.

On devices based on msm72xx chips, auto-answering is also supported.

Please see Wiki/Devices for more information.
